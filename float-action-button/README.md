When I am coding a uniapp project, I come across with a necessity of a float-action-button. However, the existing solutions does not fit my needs, so I try to code one myself.

# Features

1. Drag and drop
2. Attach to the screen side automatically after dragging and dropping
3. A set of sub-buttons are folded inside
